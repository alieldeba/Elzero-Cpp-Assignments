1. Data Size That Stored In RAM

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
 cout << sizeof(1) << endl; // Int (4 Byte)
 cout << sizeof(1.1f) << endl; // Float (4 Byte)
 cout << sizeof(1.1) << endl; // Double (8 Byte)
 cout << sizeof(true) << endl; // Bool (1 Byte)
 cout << sizeof('a') << endl; // Char (1 Byte)
}
